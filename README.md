Hey there, my name is Nathan Lapak and I am currently a senior attending J.H Picard high school. I would like to graduate as a comp sci major in university and work in tech. I 
enjoy web design and web development, competitive programming and developing simple games. I am curious about learning machine learning and artificial intelligence but 
I would need to learn he math needed (Calculus, linear algebra, statistics and probability) before I tackle this subject.
